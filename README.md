# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

Image CLASSIFICATION using KNN Algorithm

Requirements
Make sure to extract all four files, as the code will not work without them. The code requires the following packages:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Csv
Scikit-learn
Additionally, you will need two .csv files:

Images.csv
EdgeHistogram.csv
Running the Code can be run using an IDE such as Spyder, Pycharm, or any other IDE. Ensure that you have all the required packages installed. The .csv files must also be in the same directory as the code file for it to run successfully
